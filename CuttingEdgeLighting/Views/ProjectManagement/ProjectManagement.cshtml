                <h1>What is Project Management?</h1><br />
                <p>Project management is about knowing exactly what your goals are, how you’re going to achieve them, what resources you’ll need, and how long it will take you to reach that specific goal. In fact, project management’s goal is to make sure that everyone involved in a project knows these and is aware of the purpose of the project.<br /><br />The discipline itself is an organized manner of managing a project from its beginning to a defined ending. All projects need a structure. Hence, the complexity and length of the project are equivalent to a more advanced and detailed project plan.<br /><br /></p><h4>Almost every project goes through these five steps during its life cycle:</h4><br /><p>1. Discover what the client needs to determine the project’s goals.<br /><br />2.	Elaborate a plan that will tell you what needs to be done, by whom, how much it will cost, and when the project should be delivered.<br /><br />3. Start working.<br /><br />4.	Check if work goes according to the initial plan, identify problems, and make adjustments.<br /><br />5. Deliver the project and close all contracts once you get the client’s approval.<br /><br />The “project manager” is in charge of the planning and execution of a project. He / She makes sure that everything is following the client’s vision and quality standards. He / She will also be held accountable for the project’s success or failure.<br /><br />People have been “managing projects” for centuries. They went from using traditional tools such as pen and paper to the use of advanced technologies. Currently, project managers employ the use of Cutting Edge’s project management tools and software to speed up and ease the entire work process.<br /><br /></p>

                <h1>The Ipmortance of Project Management:</h1><br />
                <p>Why is project management important? Without project management, a project’s development would be chaotic. Cutting Edge Lighting’s main goal is to ensure that everyone involved in a project knows exactly what needs to be done, for how long they have to complete an activity, what resources are available, and whom they should talk to in case they encounter a problem. Cutting Edge Lighting has invested in simplifying this process for our customers.<br /><br />If everybody clearly knows what they must do, there will be much higher chances of meeting the project’s requirements and exceeding the customers expectations. Also, mistakes that otherwise would require additional time to fix are eliminated from the start as long as theres transparency between all parties. Traditionally, these could lead you to lose important data, delays, cost overruns etc. Every project will have it challenges, but at Cutting Edge Lighting we meet those complications head on with transparency and quick resolutions.<br /><br />What makes project management successful?
